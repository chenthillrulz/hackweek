      Use this opportunity to work on any activity of your passion. You choose
      if you contribute to an existing free software project or if you explore
      strange new languages, seek out new tools and new communities, if you
      boldly go where no engineer has gone before! Just

      And be open-minded, supportive, and respectful. Tech Interrupt is a happy and
      constructive place. Support ideas you like, ignore ideas you don't like.
      Help to improve ideas of others, and accept help to improve your own. Tech Interrupt is about discourse and open discussion.
      Please approach innovation with an open mind, respect, and the desire to support your fellow hackers!

    %h3 Collaborate
    %p
      We encourage you to find like-minded developers and team up to multiply
      your hacking power. Use the opportunity to work with people from other
      teams, departments or locations. Get together in an office and make use of
      all the nice things the Internet provides to collaborate remotely.

      Blog, tweet, publish videos, shout it from the roof tops so
      people can pick up your project, copy, distribute, study, change and
      improve it!

    %h3 Learn
    %p
      Tech Interrupt is also the time to pick up new tricks, by yourself and from
      each other. Use this week to expand your horizon and maybe even crack the
      books. Acquire new information, reinforce what you know, adapt your
      behavior and expand your skills!
